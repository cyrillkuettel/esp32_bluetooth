# esp32_bluetooth


This is the a sample project of using Classic Bluetooth on a ESP32 microcontroller. See also [BluetoothSerial](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/master/libraries/BluetoothSerial) for more information.


# How to use

- Download the PlatformIO PLugin for VsCode (other development environments have not tested)
- Should work out of the box, at least on Mac SO

# Troubleshooting
## No Serial Connection 
If anything fails, for whatever reason, it's always a good idea to _check the damn cable_. Experience shows, so many times, this is the issue of connection problems. I have gone through at least 4 Micro USB cables, the fourth one worked. Some cables can only charge, but not transer data.
